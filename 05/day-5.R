# Part 1

# What is the highest seat ID on a boarding pass?

# The first 7 characters will either be F or B; these specify exactly one of 
# the 128 rows on the plane (numbered 0 through 127). Each letter tells you 
# which half of a region the given seat is in. Start with the whole list of rows; 
# the first letter indicates whether the seat is in the front (0 through 63) or 
# the back (64 through 127). The next letter indicates which half of that region 
# the seat is in, and so on until you're left with exactly one row.

# The last three characters will be either L or R; these specify exactly one of
# the 8 columns of seats on the plane (numbered 0 through 7). The same process
# as above proceeds again, this time with only three steps. L means to keep the 
# lower half, while R means to keep the upper half.

# Every seat also has a unique seat ID: multiply the row by 8, then add the column.

# Part 2

# It's a completely full flight, so your seat should be the only missing 
# boarding pass in your list. However, there's a catch: some of the seats 
# at the very front and back of the plane don't exist on this aircraft, so 
# they'll be missing from your list as well.

# Your seat wasn't at the very front or back, though; the seats with IDs +1
# and -1 from yours will be in your list.

# What is the ID of your seat?

# Search through the list and find the ID that is missing

input_calc_2 <- input_calc %>% 
  arrange(seat_id) %>% # sort by seat id
  mutate(lag = lag(seat_id), # get previous row seat id
         check = lag + 1 == seat_id) %>% # check that seat id matches prev + 1
  filter(check == FALSE) # get row where it does not match

# My seat id is the non-matching one - 1
print(input_calc_2$seat_id - 1) # Answer
